# What is this?
This is me messing about.  This is an Experiment, and gives me a playground for trying stuff.  In order to try to motivate me to 
actually do stuff with this, I thought I'd try to focus it around a blog of sorts.  

# Whose terrible writing am I exposing myself to?
My Name is Giles.  I'm a software developer by trade.  I thought it was probably about time I actually put myself out there in a form which is more
in keeping with my skills and career.  I thought I could probably also publish my CV in here somewhere too.  Seems daft for someone with web dev skills
to have very little online presence.

# How does this work?
Well, since I like to experiment, this site is written mostly in markdown.  I found a helpful little node.js package called markdown-folder-to-html which will build html pages from a bunch of markdown files, and recurse through folders.  I decided this gives me a great way to throw together a static
HTML site simply, and I could use this for some form of blog, and add notes about stuff I work on or look into.  

Because I'm interested in Azure, this is (currently) hosted on an Azure web app.  It's on the free tier because I'm ~~a cheap bastard~~ unwilling to invest too much at this moment in time.  I may upgrade to a paid plan ~~when hell freezes over~~ at a later date.
